I have assumed a 6 month Quantitative Research Assistant role at the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) working on an NLP sub-project under the "Modelling for Policy Theme" at Alan Turing. My superviors are [Dr Omar A Guerrero](https://oguerr.com/) and [Dr Daniele Guariso](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/researchers/daniele-guariso).
