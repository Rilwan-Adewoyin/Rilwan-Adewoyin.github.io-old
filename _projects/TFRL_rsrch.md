title: Transformer Based RL Research Papers
description: A page I manage where I collect RL papers using Transformers. Allows you to filter by Task Domain, Transformer Role, RL Algorithm used and exploration strategy. In the future the papers posted will probably trend towards focusing on papers focusing on low resource domains (small datasets) or finance. Secondly, I will focus the RL algos on those which attempt to learn a world model or transition model.
