Dissertation [paper](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/research_students/huk/dissertation_huk_david.pdf) on developing a methodology for spatial and time-dependent conditional probabilistic rainfall forecasting using Generalised Neural Models and Gaussian copulas has been completed. My contribution was the conceptualization and implementation of Generalised Neural Models - neural models that output 3 parameters to produce predictive distributions following the tweedie distribution and zero-weighted distributions.
