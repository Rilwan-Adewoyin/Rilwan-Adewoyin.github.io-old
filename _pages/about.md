<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->


I am a passionate researcher focused on natural language processing, probabilistic neural networks, and reinforcement learning. Currently, I'm pursuing my PhD in Computer Science at the University of Warwick, where I work on controllable natural language generators, probabilistic neural methods for sequential data exhibiting skewed distributive patterns, and transformer-based reinforcement learning.

Before starting my PhD, I obtained an MSc in Statistics from the University of Warwick and a BSc in Mathematics from the London School of Economics.


My experiences in quantitative research began with an internship at a Cambridge based machine learning research lab for [Informetis](https://www.informetis.com/en/), where I developed a custom Transformer architecture for disaggregating high-frequency household power signals into individual appliance power signals. During my PhD, I spent 6 months in industry as an Associate Quantitative Researcher at J.P. Morgan and for the current 6 month window, until July 2023, I am currently a Quantitative Research Assistant at the Alan Turing Institute.
